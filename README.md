The purpose was to design a smart home server that runns guhIO and is especially fittet to the needs of single-family house builders. It is the central switching unit that can be mounted into the electrical cabinet.

Please note: guhPLC is the abbreviation for 'guh' programmable logic controller. The smart home server has no powerline interface yet.
